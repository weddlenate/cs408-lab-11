# Inventory App

## Overview

This project had us create a web page that gave the user the ability to manipulate the database we created in the last lab. The user is able to load a table with information from the database, add new items to the database, and delete items from the database.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project. 
You can then enter ">Live Preview: Start Server" into the search bar to run the website.
